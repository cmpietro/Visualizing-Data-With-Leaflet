# Visualizing-Data-With-Leaflet

This is homework unit 17.  Creating an earthquake visualization data set.  We pull data from the USGS site and after selecting a GeoJSON feed we would like to visualize, we create a map with leaflet, then plot all the earthquakes from the dataset.  

This project includes files: 

INDEX.html

logic.js
config.js
css - folder
style.css

Sadly, I got this homework functioning well, prior to the deadline, then prior to submitting I tested once again and am having issues with website responsivness and no longer have time to research and correct the issues.  I am submitting the homework as is and will correct as soon as I have time.
